This is My Capstone Project done in collaboration with 3 other people. 
 
  About the Project: Our Team conducted elaborate analysis on the liquor sales for the state of Iowa. We handled the data at hand, cleaned it, saw how it interacted with other variables and visualized it.
  We also performed advanced Machine Learning Algorithms like Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Clustering Analysis and Time Series Analysis on the dataset with promising results. 

  About the data: The data we dealt with was drawn from the government of IOWA therefore, the data at hand was live data (was updated instantaneously) so dealing with it was a new experience. 
  The data spanned from the year 2010 all the way to the present, having all the variables like brand of liquor, area, supplier and distributor, sales etc. 

  Tools used: Google Dataset, Google Colab, Power BI
